      General questions on how to do something with the calamine crate should
      be asked on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/calamine)
      with a tag of "calamine". This has a better chance of getting several
      answers and also helps others who might have similar questions in the
      future. If you don't get an answer on StackOverflow, you can come back
      here and refer to your question there.


      If your question is "Is this a bug" then please file a bug report instead.
